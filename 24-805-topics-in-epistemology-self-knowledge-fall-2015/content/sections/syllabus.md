Course Overview
---------------

This course is a graduate seminar surveying recent work on self-knowledge. Some questions that will be explored and discussed are: What is the distinctive philosophical interest of self-knowledge? Is self-knowledge really an _epistemic_ achievement? Is it plausible that there is a uniform explanation of all distinctively first-personal self-knowledge?

Prerequisites

Requirements
------------

Students were graded on the following:

*   Attendance
*   Assigned readings
*   An in-class presentation
